// starts with a $section heading.
// The $section.id is the date of the new micro-post.
// It will also be used as the unique identifier for your
// new entry both in HTML (as the fragment value) and in
// the RSS feed.
// If you want to publish more than one entry in the same
// day, add hours, minutes and seconds to the id value.
// If you get a date parsing error on build, you messed up
// the date syntax.
// You can look at this page's '.date' frontmatter field for
// an example of a correct date string.
